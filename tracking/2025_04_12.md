|-------------|--------|--------------------|
| Codeforces  | [2]    | dp problem, dp[0] is worst case, dp[1] is second worst case, think about restrictions when calculation dp[i], brute force problem to find some substrings, one edge case was wrong                    |
| Math        | [X]    | not today                    |
| Reading     | [1]    | listened to janestreet tech talk about ocaml implementation and enhancement of polymorphism                    |
| C++         | [1]    | in codeforces, #include <algorithm> for max, min, ...                   |

## 💬 Reflection

- What did I improve today?
  - learned first steps in DP, finished 1500 codeforces question, always pay attention to long long or int in c++
- What was the hardest part?
  - debugging error regarding int/long long 
- What should I focus on tomorrow?
  - Don't get discouraged in the beginning
  - really think of all edge cases, note them down actively
