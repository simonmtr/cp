# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to competitive programming problems from **Codeforces**, **AtCoder**, and **LeetCode**.
The primary goal is systematic skill development in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving under time constraints.

## Platforms

- **Codeforces** — problems organized by rating (800–1700)
- **AtCoder** — Beginner Contests and practice contests
- **LeetCode** — selected problems in python and cpp
